Scalable and distributed app and deploy in k8s

# Our experience :
When the newcomers start building their first websites, they donâ€™t know about some problems they may run into later:

- An increase in the number of visitors reduces the performance of web applications
and blows up the failures;  
- expansion of the product range negatively affects the page load time; updating 
the inventory of an e-commerce shop becomes problematic;  
- changing the code structure becomes dangerous and overcomplicated; 
- adding a new product or service take too much time and becomes expensive, 
and the possibility of carrying out the A/B tests reduces.
- Computational limitation
- Storage limitations
- Network limitation
- Failures in server

As a result, we decided to rewrite all so that our system becomes scalable, maintainable and distributed.

Issues: 
- All about embedded is bad for scaling, embedded cache, embedded database, embedded workers(jobs) etc.
